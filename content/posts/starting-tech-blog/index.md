## About me

I am Fred, a full-stack developer and architect. While I am most confortable with dotnet and react, I am a tech enthusiast and love trying out various languages, frameworks and more...

I do not believe in one solution fits all projects but that there are many options out there and the right choice depends on the answers to various questions:

> *What problem are you trying to solve?*
*Do you have time/budget constraints?*
*Which stack is your team familiar with?*
...

While I tend to favor *Functional Programming* style, I am very versatile and have been working using various paradigm and try to pick a good language/style for a given problem. From Shell scripting to Front-End, with some detour into SQL or NoSQL, and obviously without forgetting about Back-End, I enjoy having an holistic view over a project and understanding challenges at all levels.

## Welcome on *fred.sh*

The goal of this site is primarily to record my experiments with various technologies. Additionally, I find it a good opportunity to share my approach to some problems and I hope to initiate a discussion with other like-minded (or not) developers.

So here I am, starting a blogging journey. I hope this site can prove itself to be useful to you. Welcome on board, and please feel free to share your thoughts with me.
